# Agent-Based Evolutionary Simulations to Infer Coral Hybridization Impacts on Population Genetic Diversity and Adaptability

#### coral_model.slim
This is the current working model used to run the simulations

#### coral_model_spatial.slim
This is a test version of the model trialed to simulate local adaptation and habitat preference.
